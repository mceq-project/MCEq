MCEq - Matrix cascade equation
==============================

This scientific package might be useful to all who deal with high-energy inclusive atmospheric fluxes of muons and neutrinos. In particular it might be useful for experiments, for example  `IceCube <https://icecube.wisc.edu>`_ or `MINOS <http://www-numi.fnal.gov/PublicInfo/index.html>`_, for calculations of systematic uncertainties and atmospheric backgrounds.

Status
------

This **dev** branch is a pre-release of the first stable version. It has several new features
including:
- extended energy range (10 GeV - 10^11 GeV)
- new interaction models, SIBYLL 2.3 final and EPOS-LHC
- particle production from interactions of charmed hadrons (SIBYLL 2.3 only)
- a generalized target mode, with arbitrary density profiles of target material (instead of air in Earths atmosphere)

`Documentation <http://mceq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
---------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above the project is in development. The current state of the documentation is more suited for developers rather than end-users. Mostly it is auto-generated `sphinx`-docs. Check it out before touching the code.  The latest version of the documentation can be found `here <http://mceq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

System requirements
-------------------

- Some kind of modern CPU (Core2Duo++)
- 4GB (currently 8GB of RAM is strongly recommended. The solver is not optimized for memory usage, however there's lots of room for improvement)
- ~1GB of disk space
- a recent Linux or Mac OS X operating system. Windows might be suitable, but was not checked.

Software requirements
---------------------

The majority of the code consists of pure Python modules. Some functions are accelerated through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation using `numba <http://numba.pydata.org>`_, which requires the `llvmlite` package.

Dependencies:

* python-2.7 (Python 3 not compatible yet)
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* ipython + notebook (optional, but needed for examples)
* numba
* progressbar


Installation
------------
The simplest method of installation relies on the Python package manager `Anaconda/Miniconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ by `Continuum Analytics <http://www.continuum.io>`_. It not only improves your life, but also provides most of the scientific computing packages by default. It will not spoil your system Python paths and will install itself into a specified directory. The only action which is needed for activation, is to add this directory to your system `$PATH` variable. To un-install just delete this directory.

#. Download one of the installers for your system architecture from here:

	* `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ - larger download, already containing most of the scientific packages and the package manager `conda` itself
	* `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ - minimal download, which contains the minimum requirements for the package manager `conda`.

#. Run the installer and follow the instructions:

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ bash your-chosen-conda-distribution.sh

	Open a new terminal window to reload your new `$PATH` variable.


#. `Cd` to you desired working directory. And clone this project including submodules:

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/afedynitch/MCEq.git

	It will clone this github repository into a folder called `MCEq` and download all files.
	Enter this directory.

#. To install all dependencies into you new conda environment

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ conda install --file conda_req.txt

	This will ask conda to download and install all needed packages into its default environment.

#. (**Optional**) If you know what a `virtualenv` is, the corresponding commands to download and install all packages in a newly created environment `mceq_env` are

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ conda create -n mceq_env --file conda_req.txt
	   $ source activate mceq_env

	To quit this environment just

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ deactivate

#. (**Optional**) Acceleration of the integration routines can be achieved using `Intel Math Kernel Library <https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl>`_ (MKL). Anaconda offers MKL-linked numpy binaries free for academic use. It is necessary to register using your *.edu* mail address to receive a license. The demo period is 30 days. If you want to give it a try

	.. code-block:: bash

		   $ conda install mkl

	Change in `mceq_config.py` the `kernel` entry to 'MKL'.

#. Run some example

	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ ipython notebook

	click on the examples directory and select `basic_flux.ipynb`. Click through the blocks and see what happens.

Troubleshooting
---------------
You might run into `problems with Anaconda <https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/394>`_ if you have previous
Python installations. A workaround is to set the environment variable
	.. code-block:: bash

	   $ export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
